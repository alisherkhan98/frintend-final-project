              A typical tree can absorb around 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide
              (CO2) per year, however this figure is only achieved when the tree
              is fully grown.

              Over a lifetime of 100 years, one tree could absorb around a tonne
              of CO2. While this seems like a significant amount, humans are
              creating about{" "}
              <strong>40 billions tonnes of CO2 each year</strong>.

              This means that weâ€™d need to plant 40 billion trees annually to
              offset the emissions created. Even if this were possible, land
              space would be significantly reduced.
